        <br></br>
        Welcome to my portfolio. I'm a fresh Computer Science graduate from Oregon State University looking for a new grad/entry-level software engineering role where 
        I can continue learning and work on real-world, impactful projects.
        <br></br>
        My path is a bit unique, as I've worked as a professional Japanese-English translator for 10 years before transitioning into software engineering. That translation background has sharpened my attention to detail, deadline management, and teamworkâ€”skills I now bring to software development.
